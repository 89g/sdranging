# Software-defined Ranging transmitter / receiver

The code in this repository implements software components used in ranging, for exmaple in satellite applications. The implementation is loosely based on the recommendations in CCSDS 414.1-B-2. It is implemented for the bladeRF SDR, which is able to do full-duplex, fully synchronous Rx/TX operation. 

## Operation / Design
After startup, the ranging signal is generated by the ranging transmitter, and the receiver is started. The RX port shall be fed with a attentuated version of the TX output. As soon as the receiver carrier & timing syncronizers lock to the transmitted PN-sequence, the calibration process will begin to determine the sample offset between transmitter and receiver. When the offset has settled, Ctrl-C finishes the calibration process and the measurement can begin. 
The TX and RX ports shall then be connected to their corresponding amplifiers / antennas. After sequence syncronisation, the calculated two-way range to the target is continually output.

## Tradeoffs
Amateur radio transponders, whether ground-based or on the OSCARs do not feature wide bandwidths like the deep-space missions, using very high chip rates (and therefore also meter-scale-resolutions) is not possible. Therefore, a relatively low chip rate of 10 kHz with bandwidth-efficient sine wave pulse shaping is implemented, and oversampled to acheive a resolution of ~300m of two-way range.
